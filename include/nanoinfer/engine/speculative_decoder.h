/// Speculative Decoding: draft model generates k candidate tokens,
/// target model verifies them in one parallel forward pass.
///
/// Algorithm (Leviathan et al., 2023):
///   1. Draft model generates k tokens greedily (very fast)
///   2. Target model does ONE forward pass with [prompt + k draft tokens]
///   3. For each position p, compare target logits with draft token:
///      - If draft token matches target's argmax -> accept
///      - If mismatch -> reject from position p, sample from target
///   4. KV cache: draft tokens are written to target's KV cache
///      Accepted tokens stay, rejected tokens are overwritten
///   5. Repeat: draft from the last accepted position
///
/// Two modes are supported:
///
///   SELF-SPECULATION (draft_model_dir empty):
///     The target model's first `draft_layers` serve as the draft model.
///     When draft_layers == n_layers_ the draft and target are identical —
///     this is a correctness-validation configuration with 100% acceptance
///     (every draft token is guaranteed to be accepted by the target).
///     For actual wall-clock speedup set draft_layers < n_layers_
///     (e.g. n_layers_ / 4).
///
///   DUAL-MODEL (draft_model_dir set):
///     A separate (smaller/faster) draft model generates candidate tokens
///     which the target model verifies in one batched forward pass.
